Rust Autonomous Drone (RAD) Flight Controller
================================================================================
Inspired by [zeroflight](https://github.com/bartslinger/zeroflight), this
repository implements a flight controller for autonomous drone displays.

Design will explore leveraging a mesh network of the autonomous drones and
distributed computing to increase safety and robustness of the display
demonstration.


Hardware Support
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This implementation is designed to support any hardware.

I currently have a Betaflight F3, and as well as working on an ESP32 based
flight controller platform.

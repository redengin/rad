Rust Autonomous Drone (RAD) Flight Controller
================================================================================
This repository implements a flight controller for autonomous drone displays.

Design will explore leveraging a mesh network of the autonomous drones and
distributed computing to increase safety and robustness of the mission.

Hardware Support
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This implementation is designed to support any hardware.

I currently have a Betaflight F3 and working on an ESP32 based flight
controller platform.
